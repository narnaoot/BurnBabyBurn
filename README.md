We decided to investigate California fires and see if they were correlated with various human factors.  There was a great deal of information available for 1993 and 2008, so we compared these two years.  Using leaflet, we created maps of all fires > 100 acres between the two years.  Using maxent, we identified with factors were most relevant in predicting fire risk.  We used python and created flask apps to put our information online, and deployed a site to heroku.  Here are the results.
